# IDD-final-project-rainbow-blinks

## Project Idea: Follow the Rainbow
*Using Move38's Blinks to create a fun puzzle game*

*****We pivoted again from this idea back to a music synthesizer using the MetroMini and Raspberry Pi because the Blink Arduino boards were somewhat limiting for a project scope appropriate for 3 people.

## Team:
* Christine Ku (ECE)
* Yuxin Zhang (ECE)
* Fei Gao (CS)

## Prototype:
We have a slide deck shown in the [RainbowFlowPresentation.pdf](https://github.com/cku3/IDD-final-project-musical-blinks/blob/master/RainbowFlowPresentation.pdf)


## Parts Used:
* 6 Blinks boards (custom Arduinos with built in buttons and LEDs)
* Blinks development kit
* Lithium ion coin batteries
* Arduino

## Interaction Plan:
The goal of the game is to have the user connect the blinks together to create a sort of pipeline that would allow the "flow" or the flashing LEDs to travel from start to finish while dodging the blockades and following specific color order. Each blink is initalized to a different color and must be connected only to the colors adjacent to them in the rainbow order.
